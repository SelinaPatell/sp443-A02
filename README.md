Directions to follow for the Assignment(Delete later)
Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions.

This will be like a glossary at the end of a text book.

PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software. 

 Steps:
1. Go to this link and sign up for a student jetbrains license to have free access: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students 
2. Download Webstorm using this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
3. Download Git from this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
4. Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/login
5. Once you have recieve an email from jetbrain with your license, create an account and use the link they provide to access the license 
6. Copy the license ID and open Webstorm
7. Once Webstorm is open, set up and choose the default setting and install
8. Webstrom will ask for the license ID, paste it in
9. Set up **GIT** and select the default setting and install
10. Connect Git to Webstorm: Click file -> settings -> **Version control** -> **Git** -> he path in the location box
should be C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe -. click test; if successful, a message will be shown
11. Connect Github to Webstrom:  Click file -> settings -> **Version control** -> **GitHub** -> click the + -> add your account info
12. Create a new project and a git repository: in Webstorm, file -> new -> new project -> once you have your code in the file -> click Git on the top menu -> click commit -> write a message and click **commit** to **git** -> click **push** to push to github 



Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.

Branch: allows you to isolate development work without affecting other parts in the repository

Clone: creates a local copy of the repository on your computer 

Commit: saves changes to local repository with a message 

Fetch: downloads changes from the repository to the local repository

GIT: Version control system for tracking changes in your code

Github: website for hosting and collaboraing on git repositoies, saves your code and allows others to view it 

Merge: combines changes from one into another branch

Merge Conflict: when Git can't automatically merge changes from different branches

Push: uploads local repository changes to the repository on Github

Pull: downloads changes from github to local repository

Remote: version of repository stored in the cloud/serve, e.g. Github

Repository: a storage location where your projects file and versions are stored

Your commits should have clear messages like:


Task: Create Repository

Feature:  added workflow for using github

Fix:  changed readme.md for definition of terms
